  abstract = {Fake news, which can be defined as intentionally and verifiably false news, has a strong influence on critical aspects of our society. Manual fact-checking is a widely adopted approach used to counteract the negative effects of fake news spreading. However, manual fact-checking is not sufficient when analysing the huge volume of newly created information. Moreover, the number of labeled datasets is limited, humans are not particularly reliable labelers and databases are mostly in English and focused on political news. To solve these issues state-of-the-art machine learning models have been used to automatically identify fake news. However, the high amount of models and the heterogeneity of features used in literature often represents a boundary for researchers trying to improve model performances. For this reason, in this systematic review, a taxonomy of machine learning and deep learning models and features adopted in Content-Based Fake News Detection is proposed and their performance is compared over the analysed works. To our knowledge, our contribution is the first attempt at identifying, on average, the best-performing models and features over multiple datasets/topics tested in all the reviewed works. Finally, challenges and opportunities in this research field are described with the aim of indicating areas where further research is needed.},

  abstract = {Information preciseness on Internet, especially on social media, is an increasingly important concern, but web-scale data hampers, ability to identify, evaluate and correct such data, or so called "fake news," present in these platforms. In this paper, we propose a method for "fake news" detection and ways to apply it on Facebook, one of the most popular online social media platforms. This method uses Naive Bayes classification model to predict whether a post on Facebook will be labeled as REAL or FAKE. The results may be improved by applying several techniques that are discussed in the paper. Received results suggest, that fake news detection problem can be addressed with machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of misleading information in everyday access media outlets such as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers have made it challenging to identify trustworthy news sources, thus increasing the need for computational tools able to provide insights into the reliability of online content. In this paper, we focus on the automatic identification of fake content in online news. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce two novel datasets for the task of fake news detection, covering seven different news domains. We describe the collection, annotation, and validation process in detail and present several exploratory analyses on the identification of linguistic differences in fake and legitimate news content. Second, we conduct a set of learning experiments to build accurate fake news detectors, and show that we can achieve accuracies of up to 76\%. In addition, we provide comparative analyses of the automatic and manual identification of fake news.},

  abstract = {The emergence of various social networks has generated vast volumes of data. Efficient methods for capturing, distinguishing, and filtering real and fake news are becoming increasingly important, especially after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study conducts a multiaspect and systematic review of the current state and challenges of graph neural networks (GNNs) for fake news detection systems and outlines a comprehensive approach to implementing fake news detection systems using GNNs. Furthermore, advanced GNN-based techniques for implementing pragmatic fake news detection systems are discussed from multiple perspectives. First, we introduce the background and overview related to fake news, fake news detection, and GNNs. Second, we provide a GNN taxonomy-based fake news detection taxonomy and review and highlight models in categories. Subsequently, we compare critical ideas, advantages, and disadvantages of the methods in categories. Next, we discuss the possible challenges of fake news detection and GNNs. Finally, we present several open issues in this area and discuss potential directions for future research. We believe that this review can be utilized by systems practitioners and newcomers in surmounting current impediments and navigating future situations by deploying a fake news detection system using GNNs.},

  abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of \textbackslash fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},

  abstract = {Social media is becoming popular for news consumption due to its fast dissemination, easy access, and low cost. However, it also enables the wide propagation of fake news, i.e., news with intentionally false information. Detecting fake news is an important task, which not only ensures users receive authentic information but also helps maintain a trustworthy news ecosystem. The majority of existing detection algorithms focus on finding clues from news contents, which are generally not effective because fake news is often intentionally written to mislead users by mimicking true news. Therefore, we need to explore auxiliary information to improve detection. The social context during news dissemination process on social media forms the inherent tri-relationship, the relationship among publishers, news pieces, and users, which has the potential to improve fake news detection. For example, partisan-biased publishers are more likely to publish fake news, and low-credible users are more likely to share fake news. In this paper, we study the novel problem of exploiting social context for fake news detection. We propose a tri-relationship embedding framework TriFN, which models publisher-news relations and user-news interactions simultaneously for fake news classification. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods for fake news detection.},

  abstract = {The explosive growth in fake news and its erosion to democracy, justice, and public trust has increased the demand for fake news detection and intervention. This survey reviews and evaluates methods that can detect fake news from four perspectives: the false knowledge it carries, its writing style, its propagation patterns, and the credibility of its source. The survey also highlights some potential research tasks based on the review. In particular, we identify and detail related fundamental theories across various disciplines to encourage interdisciplinary research on fake news. It is our hope that this survey can facilitate collaborative efforts among experts in computer and information sciences, social sciences, political science, and journalism to research fake news, where such efforts can lead to fake news detection that is not only efficient but, more importantly, explainable.},
