  abstract = {Fake news, which can be defined as intentionally and verifiably false news, has a strong influence on critical aspects of our society. Manual fact-checking is a widely adopted approach used to counteract the negative effects of fake news spreading. However, manual fact-checking is not sufficient when analysing the huge volume of newly created information. Moreover, the number of labeled datasets is limited, humans are not particularly reliable labelers and databases are mostly in English and focused on political news. To solve these issues state-of-the-art machine learning models have been used to automatically identify fake news. However, the high amount of models and the heterogeneity of features used in literature often represents a boundary for researchers trying to improve model performances. For this reason, in this systematic review, a taxonomy of machine learning and deep learning models and features adopted in Content-Based Fake News Detection is proposed and their performance is compared over the analysed works. To our knowledge, our contribution is the first attempt at identifying, on average, the best-performing models and features over multiple datasets/topics tested in all the reviewed works. Finally, challenges and opportunities in this research field are described with the aim of indicating areas where further research is needed.},

  abstract = {This research surveys the current state‐of‐the‐art technologies that are instrumental in the adoption and development of fake news detection. “Fake news detection” is defined as the task of categorizing news along a continuum of veracity, with an associated measure of certainty. Veracity is compromised by the occurrence of intentional deceptions. The nature of online news publication has changed, such that traditional fact checking and vetting from potential deception is impossible against the flood arising from content generators, as well as various formats and genres.The paper provides a typology of several varieties of veracity assessment methods emerging from two major categories – linguistic cue approaches (with machine learning), and network analysis approaches. We see promise in an innovative hybrid approach that combines linguistic cue and machine learning, with network‐based behavioral data. Although designing a fake news detector is not a straightforward problem, we propose operational guidelines for a feasible fake news detecting system.},

  abstract = {The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.},

In this paper, we propose a method for "fake news" detection and ways to apply it on Facebook, one of the most popular online social media platforms. This method uses Naive Bayes classification model to predict whether a post on Facebook will be labeled as REAL or FAKE. The results may be improved by applying several techniques that are discussed in the paper.

  abstract = {Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender. Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search, Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to iteratively improve its style and refine its output. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering a more informed online space.},

  abstract = {The volume of data circulating from online sources is growing rapidly and comprises both reliable and unreliable information published through many different sources. Researchers are making plausible efforts to develop reliable methods for detecting and eliminating fake web news. Deep learning (DL) methods play a vital role in addressing various fake news detection problems and are found to perform better compared to conventional approaches, making them state-of-the-art in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of existent DL-based models for multimodal fake news detection, focusing on diverse aspects, including user profiles, news content, images, videos, and audio data. This study considered the latest articles within the last seven years, starting from 2018 to 2025, and about 963 quality articles were obtained from the journals and conferences selected for this study. Subsequently, 121 studies were chosen for our SLR after careful screening of the abstract and the full-text eligibility analysis. The findings showed that the Transformer models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the most popular deep learning techniques for detecting multimodal fake news, followed by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) techniques. The Twitter and Weibo datasets are the two most frequently used standard datasets, and the most frequently used metrics to evaluate the performance of these models are the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-scores. In conclusion, the limitations of the current methods were summarized and some exciting possibilities for future research were highlighted, including designing robust multilingual fake news detection systems, hybridization of deep learning models to enhance detection accuracy, integration of explainable AI (XAI), and facilitating real-time fake news detection models.},

Fake news is a vast problem in our society we cannot predict which news is fake or real without having knowledge or proof of that particular news. This has become a supreme problem, so we decided to create a solution to this problem. Thus, we built a small model which helps in detecting fake news, where we are dealing with some articles which have been collected from the internet. We have labeled each of them as either fake or true. We have trained our dataset using these articles and have used different machine learning algorithms like Passive Aggressive Classifier, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Long short term memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to compare the results. Our experimental result has achieved 99.6\% accuracy from Decision Tree algorithm and obtained 99.8\% recall from LSTM for detection of fake news. Passive Aggressive Classifier performs excellent on a large data set.},

First, we introduce two novel datasets for the task of fake news detection, covering seven different news domains. We describe the collection, annotation, and validation process in detail and present several exploratory analyses on the identification of linguistic differences in fake and legitimate news content. Second, we conduct a set of learning experiments to build accurate fake news detectors, and show that we can achieve accuracies of up to 76\%. In addition, we provide comparative analyses of the automatic and manual identification of fake news.},

  abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of \textbackslash fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},

This survey reviews and evaluates methods that can detect fake news from four perspectives: the false knowledge it carries, its writing style, its propagation patterns, and the credibility of its source. The survey also highlights some potential research tasks based on the review. In particular, we identify and detail related fundamental theories across various disciplines to encourage interdisciplinary research on fake news. It is our hope that this survey can facilitate collaborative efforts among experts in computer and information sciences, social sciences, political science, and journalism to research fake news, where such efforts can lead to fake news detection that is not only efficient but, more importantly, explainable.},
